Welcome to the Lesk Climate & Water Systems Lab.  
We study how climate change reshapes the movement of water between land and atmosphere—and how those shifts affect ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources.

# <a id="research"></a> Research

Our group investigates:

### **• Land–atmosphere water and energy exchange**
We analyze how warming alters precipitation, evaporation, soil moisture, and climate extremes.

### **• Hydrologic responses to climate change**
Understanding how shifts in rainfall timing and intensity impact drought, productivity, and water supply.

### **• Climate impacts on ecosystems and agriculture**
How climate variability cascades into ecosystem stress and crop losses.

### **• Environmental data science + modeling**
We combine global remote sensing, flux tower data, statistical models, and climate model ensembles.

We welcome collaborations.
