Welcome to the Climate Change & Impacts Lab.  
We study how climate change interacts with the terrestrial systems that underpin human thriving.
 
The group is presently growing! Feel free to reach out if you're interested in pursuing your Masters or PhD in the group.

Our group investigates:

### **• Hydroclimate change**
How precipitation intensity and intermittency change in a warming climate.

### **• Land–atmosphere water and energy exchange**
How warming alters what happens to precipitation after it falls.

### **• Climate impacts on agriculture and water resources**
How water-cycle changes affect crop yields and the continental water balance.
