Welcome to the Climate Change & Impacts Lab.  
We study how climate change reshapes the movement of water between land and atmosphere—and how those shifts affect agriculture and water resources.

# <a id="research"></a> Research

Our group investigates:

### **• Hydroclimate change**
How precipitation intensity and intermittency change in a warming climate.

### **• Land–atmosphere water and energy exchange**
How warming alters what happens to precipitation after it falls.

### **• Climate impacts on vegetation and water resources**
How water-cycle changes affect crop yields and continental water stocks.

### **• Environmental data science + modeling**
We combine global remote sensing, flux tower data, statistical models, and climate model ensembles.
