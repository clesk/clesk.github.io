  description: "How the intensity and intermittency of precipitation events are changing as the climate warms;
    the physics underlying these changes; and 
    whether climate models simulate these processes accurately."

    how the relationship between drought and heat evolves under warming; and 
    whether vegetation buffers or amplifies the drying effect of warming."
